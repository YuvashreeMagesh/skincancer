# An Experimental Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Detection and Classification of Skin Cancer

Skin cancer is among the world's most dangerous diseases. Early classification of skin lesions could significantly enhance clinical decision-making by providing accurate disease diagnoses, thereby increasing the chances of curing cancer before it spreads. Various computer-based methods are employed for detecting skin disorders. These models are typically built using prominent soft computing techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), while machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Logistic Regression are utilized for classification.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a computer-based system for the early classification of skin lesions to aid in the detection of skin cancer. By employing advanced techniques such as CNNs and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to accurately classify skin lesions, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improving patient outcomes.

## Objectives
- Develop a robust classification model capable of accurately distinguishing between different types of skin lesions.
- Implement the model into a user-friendly software application for easy integration into clinical workflows.
